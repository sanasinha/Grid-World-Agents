     *    - middleStep
     *    - terminalStep
     * When a new game is started, the Agent objects are created using their constructors. However, the game itself
     * has not been started yet, so if an Agent wishes to keep track of units/resources in the game, that info is
     * not available to it yet. The first turn of the game, each agent's initialStep method is called by sepia
     * automatically and provided the *initial* state of the game. So, this method is often used as a
     * secondary constructor to "discover" the ids of units we control, the number of players in the game, etc.
     *
     * This method produces a mapping from the ids of units we control to the actions those units will take this turn.
     * Note we are only allowed to map units that we *control* (their ids technically) to actions, we are not allowed
     * to try to control units that aren't on our team!
